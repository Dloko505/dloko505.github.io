### Welcome 

Coding is a passion I've had for quite some time but was afraid to take the risk, afraid I wasn't good enough. Now, I have spent the last few weeks learning to code at **Deep Dive Coding**, and I can't believe I have not taken the plundge into the depths sooner! While I haven't built anything completely spectacular at this point I'm having a blast destroying programs. However, I plan on focusing right now on learning the absolute basics and building a solid foundation on which I can really start to develope and create things I can love and or hate.

Some of the technologies I am currently learning and working with.

- Java
- Android
- Salesforce

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Dloko505/dloko505.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
