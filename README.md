### Welcome 

Coding is a passion I've had for quite some time but was afraid to take the risk, afraid I wasn't good enough. Now, I have spent the last few weeks learning to code at **Deep Dive Coding**, and I can't believe I have not taken the plundge into the depths sooner! While I haven't built anything completely spectacular at this point I'm having a blast destroying and fixing programs. However, I plan on focusing right now on learning the absolute basics and building a solid foundation on which I can really start to develope and create things I can love and or hate. Then figuring out exactly what I will apply my new found knowledge to will surely come easily after I get some very necessary basics covered.

Some of the technologies I am currently learning and working with.

- Android
- GitHub
